## Features

So far you can:
 - add edges
 - remove edges
 - move nodes around
 - toggle red/black property. (double-click on a node)

## Controls

- Double-clicking an edge removes it.
- To add an edge, click on a node, then another.
- To toggle a node between red and black, double-click on it.
- Nodes can be moved by dragging them around.

(It's far from finished)

Clone the repo and run `bun dev` to use it.
