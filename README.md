A sandbox for playing with [red-black trees](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Red%E2%80%93black_tree), to develop intuition about how they work.

So far you can:
 - add edges (click the first node, then the second to link them)
 - remove adges (double-click on an edge)
 - move nodes around (drag)
 - toggle red/black status. (double-click on a node)

(It's far from finished)

Clone the repo and run `bun dev` to use it.
